  Instructios for space-time interest point detection
  ----------------------------------------------------

The package contains matlab scripts that given a video sequence perform
  1) detection of interest points at given scales in space-time
  2) adaptation of detected points to the scales and velocity of the pattern
  3) computation of jet descriptors at detected and adapted points

Video sequences should be uncompressed .avi (or compressed if your
matlab version support it, see help for 'aviread'). To avoid memory
problems, the resolution should not be high. The scripts has been
tested on sequences of size 120x160x200.

All the steps 1-3 above are demonstrated within a script 'stdemo.m'
You will need to edit it to set the correct path to the demo sequence
'walk.avi' that is supplied with this package.

The script 'stscript82batch.m' allows to run the steps 1-3 for several
sequences in a batch mode and saves results of computations after each step.
The data obtained in the first two steps is a matrix Nx7 with rows corresponding
to N points and columns corresponding to the position of the points in space-time,
their scales and velocities: (y,x,t,sx,st,vx,vy). The jet descriptors obtained
from the last step are stored in the matrix Nx34 where each descriptor is a 
vector of the spatio-temporal derivative responses up to the third order,
i.e. j=(Lx,Ly,Lt,Lxx,Lxy,....,Lttt) see help for 'localjet_xyt.m'

The result of interest point detection can be demonstrated later using the
script 'stscript82c.m'
